// KeepAlive marks its argument as currently reachable.
// This ensures that the object is not freed, and its finalizer is not run,
// before the point in the program where KeepAlive is called.
//
// A very simplified example showing where KeepAlive is required:
// 	type File struct { d int }
// 	d, err := syscall.Open("/file/path", syscall.O_RDONLY, 0)
// 	// ... do something if err != nil ...
// 	p := &File{d}
// 	runtime.SetFinalizer(p, func(p *File) { syscall.Close(p.d) })
// 	var buf [10]byte
// 	n, err := syscall.Read(p.d, buf[:])
// 	// Ensure p is not finalized until Read returns.
// 	runtime.KeepAlive(p)
// 	// No more uses of p after this point.
//
// Without the KeepAlive call, the finalizer could run at the start of
// syscall.Read, closing the file descriptor before syscall.Read makes
// the actual system call.
//
// Note: KeepAlive should only be used to prevent finalizers from
// running prematurely. In particular, when used with unsafe.Pointer,
// the rules for valid uses of unsafe.Pointer still apply.
func KeepAlive(x any) {
	// Introduce a use of x that the compiler can't eliminate.
	// This makes sure x is alive on entry. We need x to be alive
	// on entry for "defer runtime.KeepAlive(x)"; see issue 21402.
	if cgoAlwaysFalse {
		println(x)
